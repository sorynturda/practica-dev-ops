steps for the next part of the setup:

1. Create a Vagrantfile that will replicate the VM setup you currently have created manually
2. Create 2 Ansible playbooks that will provision each VM - one for the application and one of the DB. Here I'd recommend you use 2 roles and just call those roles from a main.yml or something similar. Keep it as simple as possible 
3. Call the Ansible main.yml from a bootstrap step in the Vagrantfile after the VMs are created and up and running

the final setup should ideally be you just run "vagrant up" and after the VMs are created and provisioned you can just see the application in the browser

also... i'd be a good idea to put all of this in Git so we can make changes in the future doing PRs so we can work in a scenario that's close to real life
