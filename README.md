# **DevOps Project**

## **About This Project**  
This project focuses on **automating the deployment of a web application** using DevOps tools and best practices. It showcases how to efficiently set up and manage infrastructure while ensuring scalability and maintainability.  

## **ðŸ”§ Key Features**  
- **Infrastructure Automation**: Uses **Ansible** and **Vagrant** to automate provisioning and configuration.  
- **Multi-Machine Deployment**:  
  âœ… **Backend & Database run on separate virtual machines**  
  âœ… **Frontend is accessible from the host machine**  
- **Containerization & Virtualization**: Leverages **Linux OS, Virtual Machines, and Bash scripting** for automation.
